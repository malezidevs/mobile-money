## Introduction

This is a *Laravel 5.5+* package for mobile-money and Equity API. 
The API allows a merchant to initiate C2B,B2C and B2B transactions including balance query and reversals.

This package includes Controllers, Migrations and Routes which simplifies everything for you.
You only need to setup a few things in the published configuration file and you are good to go.
It comes with a admin section to monitor transactions, send money via b2c and reverse transactions.

## Installation

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require dervisgroup/mobile-money
```

## Usage

This package does not require you to register any service providers or aliases.

First, publish configuration files
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="DervisGroup\Pesa\PesaServiceProvider"
```
This will publish the M-mobile-money configuration file into the `config` directory as
`pesa.php`. 
This file contains all the configurations required to use the package. 

Go to [Safaricom Developer Portal](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke) to get app credentials.

### Mpesa

*STK PUSH REQUEST*

Sim Toolkit Request is where you initiate a payment request, the request is then pushed to users phone to validate the transaction by entering their MPESA PIN .

``mpesa_request('07xxxxxxxx',1,'reference','description')``
> MPESA recently allowed transactions of even KES 1.00

This package emits `DervisGroup\Pesa\Events\StkPushPaymentSuccessEvent` if an STK payment was processed successfully. 
If an STK request payment is unsuccessful, it emits `DervisGroup\Pesa\Events\StkPushPaymentFailedEvent`. Both events exposes the initial request model to the registered event handlers.

A nice and efficient way to tap this events is to register a event listener in your EventServiceProvider
````
<?php

namespace Dervis\Providers;

use DervisGroup\Pesa\Events\C2bConfirmationEvent;
use DervisGroup\Pesa\Events\StkPushPaymentFailedEvent;
use DervisGroup\Pesa\Events\StkPushPaymentSuccessEvent;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Support\Providers\EventServiceProvider as ServiceProvider;

class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * The event listener mappings for the application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $listen = [
        C2bConfirmationEvent::class => [
            PaymentConfirmed::class,
        ],
        StkPushPaymentFailedEvent::class => [
            StkPaymentFailed::class,
        ],
        StkPushPaymentSuccessEvent::class => [
            StkPaymentReceived::class,
        ],
    ];
}

````

*C2B Confirmation*

The C2B Confirmation is sent to registered URL's above, 
This confirmation is sent for both STK Push payment and User Initiated Payment _(Normal paybill number > Account NUmber > Amount > PIN or Till Number > Amount  > PIN)_

You can get the payment payload in the event handler like above ...

More documentation is in progress.

### Register C2B Callback Url

> Note: Please use https. You will get weird errors if use non secure URL's for callback

If you have setup `env('APP_URL)` in your ``.env`` you can used predefined endpoints in your published config file.
There are routes already registered to handle the incoming request.
```bash
php artisan mpesa:register_url
```
This will prompt you for the endpoints and send the for registration

## Testing

``` bash
$ composer test
```
